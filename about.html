        <h2>A Little About Myself</h2>
        <p>I am currently a Sophomore Computational Media Student at the Georgia Institute of Technology. I love playing my violin and guitar, drawing, and watching shows and movies on Disney+ and Netflix.</p>
        <p>I aspire to be a part of the force that brings about positive change that will affect the world for many generations. I chose my major because it presents me with a Computer Science background but also gives me the ability to learn about how I can apply those skills creatively and effectively.</p>
